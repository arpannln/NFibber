* User is able to enter n and retrieve the nth value from the Fibonacci sequence
* User is warned about invalid ns
* Unique visual representation of the Fibonacci value is presented

# Initial Goals
1. (Creatively?) prompt user for n 
2. Optimally find the Nth Fibonacci number
3. Visually display the solution, with a hard number as well as a visual representation
4. Educate on what Fibonacci is and what the visual representation even means

# Possible Future Features 
1. Allow user to directly interact with the visual presentation
2. Toss out my algorithm and pull data from outside sources to improve performance
3. Add Golden Spiral manipulation
